perl script that writes in html files
it uses the names of the files to position them in the website, i.e main-sub.html will be a submenu of the 'main' node/main-sub-foo-bar.html is the 'bar' sub of 'foo' of 'sub' of 'main'
possibility of having a breadcrumb

1. set header1, 2 and 3 with different static lines (those lines will be exactly the same in each file)
2. edit edit.pl to fit you use (what will be different, specific cases, etc)

not really usable but might give you some ideas
